## Hi there, I'm Lynn! 

Iâ€™m a Full Stack Engineer with 7+ years of experience building scalable web and mobile applications using technologies like React, React Native, TypeScript, and Node.js. Iâ€™m passionate about delivering seamless user experiences, and I love working on both frontend and backend systems. 

When I am not building engaging mobild & web experiences at [Gopuff](https://gopuff.com); you can find me tinkering with new technologies like **Astro** to build my portfolio site or building out some of the cool ideas I get like - [SubScrbd](https://mysubbuddy.vercel.com)

Iâ€™m always open to new opportunities to collaborate on innovative projects, mentor developers, or share my knowledge. Feel free to reach out to me via [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/mugambilynn) or [Email Me](lynnlmugambi@gmail.com). Let's create something great together!
